12/25/2017 next step: don't start the clock immediately on hitting endpoint /startgame.
have it wait for a response

- Lift state up { pending } to game route. Render <Pending /> if state.pending is true.

- From game we want to set pending to false from pending component. (pass such function as prop)

* There is not startfight endpoint. Could prove to be an issue

- Upon choose game from menu, hit postuser endpoint with currentUser and gameId

- Eventually the page should be locked after posting a game

- On logout should reroute to home

- On every game finish, apply difference to balance of participating players
