- add "pot" attribute to pokerHand infrastructure

- fix auto-looking after hand finish

- probably want the stacks in each pokerHand

- stacks should be hash map not array of hash maps

- write test for bet. should be fun

- memoize poker hands!!!

- each hand should have a "string" attribute i.e. "Ah5s3cKh3d"
